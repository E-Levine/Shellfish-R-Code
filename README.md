# Shellfish-R-Code
Repository for Shellfish R code including practice code, example code, and assorted project codes. <br>
<br>
## Structure
All code should be stored in folders named with a basic descriptive name (i.e., 'Power_Analysis_2021', 'Fisheries_Recruit_practice'). <br>
Each folder should have a README providing background information on the project or practice and a description of subfolders and files included. <br>
<br>
*Changes to code will require approval from repo owner or code owner.* <br>
*As new folders are added, the author will be added to the files as code owner. Please alert repo owner if you do NOT want to be added as the code owner.*
